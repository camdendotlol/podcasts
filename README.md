# Podcast App

There will be an actual name eventually.

The goal of this project is to create a podcast app that will run in the browser as well as on the desktop via Electron. The browser version will be prioritized first.

The title, repo name, and URL will change once a proper name is selected.

Notes for development:

[React Player npm package for audio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player)
